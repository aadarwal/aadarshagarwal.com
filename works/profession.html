            <h1>Profession</h1>
            <h2>by Isaac Asimov</h2>
            
            <p><em>Profession, copyright Â©1957 by Street and Smith Publications, Inc., from ISAAC ASIMOV: THE COMPLETE STORIES OF VOL. 1 by Isaac Asimov.</em></p>

            <p>George Platen could not conceal the longing in his voice. It was too much to suppress. He said, "Tomorrow's 1 May. Olympics!"</p>

            <p>He rolled over on his stomach and peered over the foot of his bed at his roommate. Didn't he feel it, too? Didn't this make some impression on him?</p>

            <p>George's face was thin and had grown a trifle thinner in the nearly year and a half that he had been at the House. His figure was slight but the look in his blue eyes was as intense as it had ever been, and right now there was a trapped look in the way his fingers curled against the bedspread.</p>

            <p>George's roommate looked up briefly from his book and took the opportunity to adjust the light-level of the stretch of wall near his chair. His name was Hali Omani and he was a Nigerian by birth. His dark brown skin and massive features seemed made for calmness, and mention of the Olympics did not move him.</p>

            <p>"I know, George."</p>

            <p>George owed much to Hali's patience and kindness when it was needed, but even patience and kindness could be overdone.</p>

            <p>Was this a time to sit there like a statue built of some dark, warm wood?</p>

            <p>George wondered if he himself would grow like that after ten years here and rejected the thought violently. No!</p>

            <p>He said defiantly, "I think you've forgotten what May means."</p>

            <p>The other said, "I remember very well what it means. It means nothing! You're the one who's forgotten that. May means nothing to you, George Platen, and," he added softly, "It means nothing to me, Hali Omani."</p>

            <p>George said, "The ships are coming in for recruits. By June, thousands and thousands will leave with millions of men and women heading for any world you can name, and all that means nothing?"</p>

            <p>"Less than nothing. What do you want me to do about it, anyway?" Omani ran his finger along a difficult passage in the book he was reading and his lips moved soundlessly.</p>

            <p>George watched him. Damn it, he thought, yell scream; you can do that much. Kick at me, do anything.</p>

            <p>It was only that he wanted not to be so alone in his anger. He wanted not to be the only one so filled with resentment, not to be the only one dying a slow death.</p>

            <p><em>[This is an excerpt from "Profession" by Isaac Asimov. The full story involves George Platen's struggle after being rejected from traditional education and sent to a facility for those deemed incapable of learning through conventional methods. The story explores themes of education, personal value, and the discovery that even those considered "failures" by society can make unique contributions.]</em></p>

            <p><strong>About the Story:</strong> "Profession" is a science fiction novella that first appeared in the July 1957 issue of Astounding Science Fiction.
