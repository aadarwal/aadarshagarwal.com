            <h1>Reflections of a Young Man on the Choice of a Profession</h1>
            <p><em>by Karl Marx (written in 1835 as a school essay when Marx was 17 years old)</em></p>

            <p>Nature herself has determined the sphere of activity in which the animal should move, and it peacefully moves within that sphere, without attempting to go beyond it, without even an inkling of any other. To man, too, the Deity gave a general aim, that of ennobling mankind and himself, but he left it to man to seek the means by which this aim can be achieved; he left it to him to choose the position in society most suited to him, from which he can best uplift himself and society.</p>

            <p>This choice is a great privilege of man over other living beings, but at the same time it is an act which can destroy his whole life, frustrate all his plans, and make him unhappy. Serious consideration of this choice, therefore, is certainly the first duty of a young man who is beginning his career and does not want to leave his most important affairs to chance.</p>

            <p>Everyone has an aim in view, which to him at least seems great, and actually is so if the deepest conviction, the innermost voice of the heart declares it so, for the Deity never leaves mortal man wholly without a guide; he speaks softly but with certainty.</p>

            <p>But this voice can easily be drowned, and what we took for inspiration can be the product of the moment, which another moment perhaps destroys. Our imagination, perhaps, is set on fire, our emotions excited, phantoms flit before our eyes, and we plunge headlong into what impetuous instinct suggests, which we imagine the Deity himself has pointed out to us. But what we ardently embrace soon repels us and we see our whole existence in ruins.</p>

            <p>We must therefore seriously examine whether we have really been inspired in our choice of a profession, whether an inner voice approves it, or whether this inspiration is a delusion, and whether what we took to be a call from the Deity was merely self-deception. But how can we recognize this except by tracing the source of the inspiration itself?</p>

            <p>What is great glitters, its glitter arouses ambition, and ambition can easily have produced the inspiration, or what we took to be inspiration; but reason can no longer restrain the man who is tempted by the demon of ambition, and he plunges headlong into what impetuous instinct suggests: he no longer chooses his position in life, instead it is determined by chance and illusion.</p>

            <p>Nor are we called upon to adopt the position which offers us the most brilliant opportunities; that is not the one which, in the long series of years in which we may perhaps hold it, will never tire us, never dampen our zeal, never let our enthusiasm grow cold, but one in which we shall soon see our wishes fulfilled, our ideas realized, and we shall not be dissatisfied with our position and achievements.</p>

            <p>The chief guide which must direct us in the choice of a profession is the welfare of mankind and our own perfection. It should not be thought that these two interests could be in conflict, that one would have to destroy the other; on the contrary, man's nature is so constituted that he can attain his own perfection only by working for the perfection, for the good, of his fellow men.</p>

            <p><em>Note: This is an abridged version of Karl Marx's essay. The complete text, written in German, was a school assignment when he was 17.</em></p>
