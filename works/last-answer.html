            <h1>The Last Answer</h1>
            <p><em>by Isaac Asimov</em></p>

            <p>Murray Templeton was forty-five years old, in the prime of life, and with all parts of his body in perfect working order except for certain key portions of his coronary arteries, but that was enough.</p>

            <p>The pain had come suddenly, had mounted to an unbearable peak, and had then ebbed steadily. He could feel his breath slowing and a kind of gathering peace washing over him.</p>

            <p>There was no question in his mind. It was a heart attack, and a massive one. And he was dying.</p>

            <p>It did not surprise him that he felt no fear. There was no room for fear in his mind right now. He felt only a vast sense of disappointment that he had come to the end of all problems—and of all problem solving.</p>

            <p>As the light dimmed, the thought crossed his mind that he would not now have the answer to what he had come to think of as the Templeton problem, for he had worked on it for the greater part of his adult life and it was still unresolved.</p>

            <p>Murray Templeton's eyes were closing and the world around him was fading, when a voice said, "I've been waiting for you."</p>

            <p>And things weren't fading after all, for although Templeton did not actually see anything, he felt as though bright light were all around him.</p>

            <p>He said, or thought, "Is it over?"</p>

            <p>The voice said, "Yes, it's over. You've been very successful. You brought about an end exactly when we had planned."</p>

            <p>"We?"</p>

            <p>"I've been watching you. I've been a part of you in a way, ever since you were born. I've been nurturing you, encouraging you, pushing you along right paths. When your schoolwork might have led you to a career as a poet, I helped you instead to go into physics. When you might have married a young woman who would have led you along a trivial path, I helped push you towards a woman who was worthy of you."</p>

            <p>"You sound like God," said Templeton.</p>

            <p>That amused the Voice. It said, "Not at all. I am merely another being whose life is infinitely further advanced than yours along the path that you have been following. As you to an ant who might imagine himself equal to you, so I am to you."</p>

            <p>"And you've been guiding my life?"</p>

            <p>"In a way. I've been encouraging those aspects of it that have been congenial to my plans."</p>

            <p>"Now what happens?" said Templeton.</p>

            <p>"A great deal happens. I have use for you. You are going to be part of me, added to me, and you will contribute your uniqueness to my existence. I have gone through this many times before and now I want you."</p>

            <p>Templeton found himself flinching away from the Voice in his mind. "Uniqueness? I have none. I am a physicist and many are better than I am. I've thought all my life on the Templeton problem, but I haven't solved it."</p>

            <p>"I know about the Templeton problem. I know your theory that the Universe has reached the maximum of entropy, and that the substance of the Universe must break down into random chaos. You were trying to find a way to reverse the process and restore purpose to the Universe."</p>

            <p>"Yes, I was. But I don't see how that—"</p>

            <p>"It does not matter. The problem was given you to occupy your mind. You might have wondered about my purpose, otherwise, and perhaps become too concerned about it. It is good that you worked on entropy, and you did well, even though you did not find the answer. Others, working on their own problems, each in their own way, however, have found parts of the answer, though they do not know that. Together, I am forming the answer."</p>
