            <h1>On the Indian Economy</h1>
            <h2>by Bibek Debroy</h2>
            
            <p><em>Excerpts from various writings and speeches by Bibek Debroy, Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India and a distinguished economist.</em></p>

            <p>India's economic reforms can be traced back to 1991, when the country faced a severe balance of payments crisis. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that everything changed suddenly in 1991. Some reforms had already been initiated in the 1980s. Indeed, even in the 1970s, there were committees that had recommended policy changes. However, it is true that the pace of reforms quickened after 1991.</p>

            <p>What were these reforms about? First, they were about dismantling the system of government licenses that controlled private sector investment decisions. Second, they were about reducing import duties and integrating India with the world economy. Third, they were about reducing tax rates and simplifying the tax structure. Fourth, they were about revamping the public sector and the financial sector. Fifth, they were about making government more efficient and accountable.</p>

            <p>The economic outcomes have been remarkable. Between 1950 and 1980, India's per capita GDP growth was around 1.5 percent per annum. This increased to 3 percent in the 1980s, 4 percent in the 1990s and over 5 percent since 2000. India's share of global GDP has also increased from around 3 percent in 1990 to around 7 percent today. The country is now the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity.</p>

            <p>But serious challenges remain. Despite improvements, we still have high levels of poverty and inequality. Our physical infrastructure needs massive investments. The quality of our education and healthcare systems is a major concern. We need to create jobs for the millions of young people entering the workforce every year. We need to become a more globally competitive economy. We need to ensure environmental sustainability. And we need to improve the quality of our institutions.</p>

            <p>There is also much unfinished business on the reform agenda. We need to further streamline our labor laws, which still discourage formal employment. We need to reform the land acquisition process, which is still cumbersome and unclear in parts. We need to further reform the financial sector and the public sector. We need to improve the quality of public expenditure. We need to strengthen the rule of law and the enforcement of contracts. And we need to further improve the ease of doing business.</p>

            <p>But the most important unfinished agenda is the reform of state capacity. The Indian state simply doesn't have the capacity to deliver the range of public goods and services that a modern economy needs. This is true at all levels - central, state and local. And it is true across all domains - from education and healthcare to law and order and regulation.</p>

            <p>Reform of state capacity is difficult because it requires changing the way the government works. It requires changing recruitment, training, evaluation and promotion systems. It requires changing organizational structures and processes. It requires changing the relationship between politicians and bureaucrats. And it requires changing the relationship between citizens and the state.</p>

            <p>But this is a reform that we cannot afford to postpone. Because without a more capable state, we will not be able to achieve our development goals. We will not be able to compete effectively in the global economy. And we will not be able to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared widely.</p>

            <h1>An Address to the Youth of India</h1>
            <h2>by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h2>

            <p><em>Delivered at various educational institutions across India.</em></p>

            <p>I have three visions for India. In my first vision, I see transformed India. In my second vision, I see the development of India and the world. In my third vision, I see India as a developed nation.</p>

            <p>I was born in a very ordinary family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. I was just like any of you. I was fortunate to have great teachers who gave me courage, confidence, and vision. It was an exceptional experience that shaped my thinking and helped me to become what I am today.</p>

            <p>What makes a nation great? It is the youth. Youth consists of a dream that is to be achieved. When a nation thinks collectively of what can be done, then the possibilities become very real. The real success of a nation is that billions of youth aspire for a great nation.</p>

            <p>I have met 20 million youth in a decade's time and I learnt what exactly they want to be. I am going to present to you what the youth of this nation wants to be. A ten-point oath from the youth:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>I will have a goal and work hard to achieve that goal. I realize that small aim is a crime.</li>
                <li>I will work with integrity and succeed with integrity.</li>
                <li>I will be a good member of my family, a good member of the society, a good member of the nation and a good member of the world.</li>
                <li>I will always try to save or better someone's life, without any discrimination of caste, creed, language, religion or state.</li>
                <li>I will always protect and enhance the dignity of every human life without any bias.</li>
                <li>I will always remember the importance of time. My motto will be: Let not my winged days be spent in vain.</li>
                <li>I will always work for clean environment and make it a clean energy environment.</li>
                <li>As a youth of my nation, I will work and work with courage to achieve success in all my tasks and enjoy the success of others.</li>
                <li>I am a youth with great potential, and I will keep my self away from all destructive habits, which will weaken my health, mind, and character and will make me unfit for mission of life.</li>
                <li>My National Flag flies in my heart and I will bring glory to my nation.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Let me share with you my life's message: "Dream, Dream, Dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action." You are as good as anyone in the world. Secondly, learning gives creativity, creativity leads to thinking, thinking provides knowledge, and knowledge makes you great.</p>

            <p>I have seen many difficult situations in my life. I have often failed and faced criticism and opposition from all directions. But my deep conviction is that each problem has a solution. We must work hard to achieve it.</p>

            <p>My message to you, my young friends, is to inculcate the following characters: The courage to think different, courage to invent, courage to discover the impossible, and courage to combat the problems and succeed are the unique qualities of the youth. With this, the youth can ignite the minds of Indians towards greatness.</p>

            <p>Remember, the ignited mind of the youth is the most powerful resource on the earth, above the earth and under the earth. Remember, you are born with a divine mission: a mission of making India a developed nation. I wish you all great success in your mission.</p>
