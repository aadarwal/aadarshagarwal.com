            <h1>Thoughts on Man's Purpose in Life</h1>
            <h2>by Admiral Hyman G. Rickover</h2>
            
            <p><em>Excerpts from Admiral Rickover's speech to the Columbia University Engineering School in 1982</em></p>

            <p>I believe it is the duty of each of us to act as if the fate of the world depended on him. Admittedly, one man by himself cannot do the job. However, one man can make a difference. Each of us is obligated to make our own contribution. We are all accountable for how we use the abilities and opportunities with which we have been blessed. We live in a society where almost everything is possible, but which seems increasingly unable to solve its problems.</p>

            <p>Let me ask you: What is the purpose of a man's life? I have pondered this question for many years and believe I have found the answer. I believe the purpose of life is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to matter, to have it make a difference that you lived at all.</p>

            <p>Let me give you a few guidelines to lead a useful life: First, carefully define worthwhile, attainable objectives and work towards achieving them. Accomplishment and hard work, if it benefits others or enables others to be better off is, I believe, the purpose of life.</p>

            <p>Second, it seems to me that human relationships are the most important thing in life. They provide the framework wherein we learn to help others, love others and, by doing those things, helping and developing ourselves. They also provide joy and happiness to life.</p>

            <p>Third, we must learn to communicate, to express our ideas, to listen to others. Human relationships depend on communication.</p>

            <p>Fourth, we must accept responsibility for our actions and the results of our decisions.</p>

            <p>What kind of world are we living in? We are living in a world in transition - a world which emphasizes value only where there is a direct, material profit; a world in which qualities count for less than quantities; where expediency takes precedence over principle; where knowledge is frequently confused with information; where decisions are made by computers and where facts are too often confused with truth.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, individual initiative, self-reliance, and personal responsibility are essential for success in this life and are still the values that bring real success and happiness.</p>

            <p>I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity an obligation; every possession a duty.</p>

            <p>There are many smart people in our country, but far fewer wise ones. We should strive to become wise. A smart man knows the answers, but a wise man knows the questions. A smart man gives solutions to problems, but a wise man prevents them. A smart man knows how to make a living, but a wise man knows how to live.</p>

            <p>Success is characterized by our ability to keep expanding our horizon. Every time we reach what we thought was the limit of our endurance, we find that we can go still further. I believe that the best way to face the future is to face it with resolution, with intelligent restraint, with courage and with faith. Those qualities our country, and each of us as individuals, must have if we are to overcome the critical problems of our world.</p>

            <h1>Beyond Smart</h1>
            <h2>by Paul Graham</h2>

            <p><em>From Paul Graham's writings on technology, startups, and excellence.</em></p>

            <p>When we were kids, being called "smart" was a compliment. As adults it's a consolation prize. When someone calls you smart, they're often implying the interesting ideas you're describing are impractical.</p>

            <p>Intelligence seems an unalloyed good to kids. One of the most shocking discoveries you make as a child is that many adults dislike it.</p>

            <p>Most explicitly in popular culture, where the smart character is typically either the villain or an annoying assistant to the hero. And more subtly but just as powerfully in everyday interaction, where people dislike anyone who seems to be trying to show them up by appearing smarter.</p>

            <p>If intelligence is frowned upon by society, why is it also admired? People readily admit some famous people are smart, like Stephen Hawking or Albert Einstein. The kind of intelligence that gets you ridiculed at 15 gets you admiringly profiled at 50. What happens in between?</p>

            <p>What happens is that people who are smart in some way become really good at something. When you're trying to solve problems, being smarter means you're more likely to succeed. And once you succeed, society can't deny your achievements, even if it resents the intelligence that enabled them.</p>

            <p>So if you're smart you should probably build things rather than just play the smartness game. It's all too easy to spend your whole life cooking up clever remarks to impress people, while making nothing substantial yourself.</p>

            <p>But intelligence is not the most important quality. There are many qualities that matter more than intelligence in determining success: determination, for example. If determination and intelligence are both our variables, I'm not sure which would have the larger coefficient.</p>

            <p>In some kinds of work, intelligence is the most important quality. In math and physics, for example, the smartest people get the furthest. But there are many kinds of work in which intelligence is not the most important quality. In many kinds of business, for example, intelligence is not the most important quality. Understanding people and knowing what they'll pay for are more important.</p>

            <p>Being smart is often overvalued. Intelligence does matter, but mostly as a threshold. It doesn't help you as much to be smarter than your competitors as it does to be more determined. Understand your comparative advantage and play to your strengths.</p>

            <p>So yes, intelligence matters. But not as much as curiosity, enthusiasm, and perseverance. The smart can easily become lazy or cynical. The truly successful combine intelligence with these other qualities to build things of lasting value.</p>
