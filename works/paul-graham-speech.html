            <h1>How to Do What You Love</h1>
            <h2>by Paul Graham</h2>
            
            <p><em>From Paul Graham's essay collection.</em></p>

            <p>To do something well you have to like it. That idea is not exactly novel. We've got it down to four words: "Do what you love." But it's not enough just to tell people that. Doing what you love is complicated.</p>

            <p>The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn't—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.</p>

            <p>And it did not seem to be an accident. School, it was implied, was tedious because it was preparation for grownup work.</p>

            <p>The world then was divided into two groups, grownups and kids. Grownups, like some kind of cursed race, had to work. Kids didn't, but they did have to go to school, which was a dilute version of work meant to prepare us for the real thing. Much as we disliked school, the grownups all agreed that grownup work was worse, and that we had it easy.</p>

            <p>Teachers in particular all seemed to believe implicitly that work was not fun. Which is not surprising: work wasn't fun for most of them. Why did we have to memorize state capitals instead of playing dodge ball? For the same reason they had to watch over a bunch of kids instead of lying on a beach. You couldn't just do what you wanted.</p>

            <p>I'm not saying we should let little kids do whatever they want. They need to be told what to do, just as larvae need to be stuffed full of food constantly if they're to become butterflies instead of dying. But as kids get older, they should be given more freedom. If you want to make ambitious people waste their time on errands, the way to do it is to bait the hook with prestige.</p>

            <p>The world changes when you're in your teens, not just for humans but for all social mammals. Juvenile mammals have a special way of playing: they improvise. Domesticated animals like dogs retain this trait into adulthood. But wild animals become more cautious. The reason the young play, biologically, is to learn skills they'll need as adults. Once wild animals are grown, they have to play for keeps. Adult wild animals generally don't play.</p>

            <p>In almost any group of people you'll find hierarchy. When groups of adults form in the real world, it's generally for some common purpose, and the leaders end up being those who are best at it. The problem with most schools is, they have no purpose. But hierarchy there must be. And so the kids make one out of nothing.</p>

            <p>What you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends. You shouldn't worry about prestige. Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world. When you can ask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know?</p>

            <p>Prestige is like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy. It causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself.</p>

            <h1>What You Can't Say</h1>
            <h2>by Paul Graham</h2>

            <p><em>From Paul Graham's essay collection.</em></p>

            <p>Have you ever seen an old photo of yourself and been embarrassed at the way you looked? Did we actually dress like that? We did. And we had no idea how silly we looked. It's the nature of fashion to be invisible, in the same way the movement of the earth is invisible to all of us riding on it.</p>

            <p>What scares me is that there are moral fashions too. They're just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people. But they're much more dangerous. Fashion is mistaken for good design; moral fashion is mistaken for good. Dressing oddly gets you laughed at. Violating moral fashions can get you fired, ostracized, imprisoned, or even killed.</p>

            <p>If you could travel back in a time machine, one thing would be true no matter where you went: you'd have to watch what you said. Opinions we consider harmless could have gotten you in big trouble. I've already said at least one thing that would have gotten me in big trouble in most of Europe in the seventeenth century, and that's that I don't believe in God.</p>

            <p>No one gets in trouble for saying that 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall. Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or at worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to make anyone mad. The statements that make people mad are the ones they worry might be believed. I suspect the statements that make people maddest are those they worry might be true.</p>

            <p>If Galileo had said that people in Padua were ten feet tall, he would have been regarded as a harmless eccentric. Saying the earth orbited the sun was another matter. The church knew this would set people thinking.</p>

            <p>To launch a taboo, a group has to be poised halfway between weakness and power. A confident group doesn't need taboos to protect it. It's not considered improper to make disparaging remarks about Americans, or the English. And yet a group has to be powerful enough to enforce a taboo.</p>

            <p>So my answer to the pajama question is: wouldn't it be nice if adults could still express themselves that way? I'm not saying we should. But it would be nice if we could. When you see how differently other cultures see things, you realize the significance of mass media. It wasn't till I was in college that I realized what had been happening all along: the bank had been cutting out the best bills.</p>

            <p>It's important to realize that, no matter what you do, you will be on the wrong side of this curve for some people. The hopeful news is that, by simply thinking about what you can't say, you've already gone a lot further than most people ever do. Scientists go looking for trouble. This is one way the very best work differs from ordinary work. Conventional-minded people care more about the opinion of the group than truth.</p>

            <p>Training yourself to think unthinkable thoughts has advantages beyond the thoughts themselves. It's like stretching. When you stretch before running, you put your body into positions much more extreme than any it will assume during the run. If you think things that would get you stoned to death in the streets of 2100 BC, you'll have no trouble thinking up doubtful things about the present.</p>

            <p>This is one of those questions where the best answer is not to answer it. But I've given some thought to it, and I think I can propose some ideas that would introduce more truth into the world and yet cause less trouble than telling people what I really think.</p>
