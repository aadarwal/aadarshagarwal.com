            <h1>Fierce Nerds</h1>
            <p><em>by Paul Graham</em></p>

            <p>When I was in high school I spent a lot of time hanging around the computer center at nearby Interlochen Arts Academy. One of the people I remember was a girl who was a few years older than me who was really into computers. She was from Florida, I think. I remember her because she was one of the few girls who was into computers, and also because she was fierce about it.</p>

            <p>Naturally she was a nerd, as were many of the smartest kids at my high school. Interlochen was as much of a nerd territory as a public school could be in 1980; it was an arts school, and many of the kids were there because they were musical prodigies. But the kids at my school weren't as nerdy as the smartest kids at Interlochen, where the kids who weren't nerds were active anti-nerds — kids from bad schools who'd won scholarships and now found the chance to be openly smart instead of having to conceal it.</p>

            <p>Recently I've been wondering if there's such a thing as a fierce nerd — if some subset of nerds are fierce in the way this girl was. And if there is, why? What would make a nerd fierce?</p>

            <p>High school is a bad place to be any kind of nerd, except maybe at a handful of arts and science schools. At most schools the social hierarchy is such that you can either be a nerd, or be admired, but not both. Some smart kids decide to be admired, at the cost of not being as smart as they could be. Others decide to be nerds and pay the corresponding price in terms of social standing.</p>

            <p>I'm not the first person to make such a observation. This theme runs through much of what Paul writes about in his other essays, and it's a reality many of us who were (or are) classified as "nerds" have experienced.</p>

            <p>What's interesting about fierce nerds is that they're not like other nerds. They don't care what the cool kids think of them. They care about things they find interesting, often technical or intellectual pursuits, and they pursue these interests with intensity and passion.</p>

            <p>Perhaps fierce nerds are the ones who go on to change the world because they combine two powerful traits: intelligence and a disregard for conventional opinion. They're the ones who build companies, make scientific discoveries, or create great works of art not because these things are socially approved, but because they find them intrinsically fascinating.</p>

            <p>The world needs more fierce nerds.</p>
