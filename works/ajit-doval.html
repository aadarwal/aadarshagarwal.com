            <h1>State and Statecraft</h1>
            <h2>by Ajit Doval, National Security Advisor of India</h2>
            
            <p><em>Selected excerpts from speeches and lectures by Ajit Doval on national security, strategy, and statecraft.</em></p>

            <p>The concept of national security has undergone a change. Wars are no longer fought on the battlefield alone. New areas have emerged. Technology has become a new frontier that has to be protected. Artificial intelligence and data are the new frontiers of international rivalry.</p>

            <p>Size of the country, population, resources, geographical position - all of these are important for security. But the most important factor is the political will of a nation. A nation with strong political will can convert its weaknesses into strength and emerge as a strong power.</p>

            <p>In the modern world, the first line of defense is not on the borders. It's in good governance. If your internal situation is vulnerable, if there are rifts within the society, if there is corruption, if there is lack of development, then your security becomes vulnerable.</p>

            <p>There are two ways of looking at security. Traditional security is about protecting territory and sovereignty. But the new concept of security is about ensuring the ability of a nation to rise to its full potential. It's about creating conditions where a nation can develop freely, where its people can live in peace, and where it can interact with the world from a position of strength.</p>

            <p>It's important for a nation to identify its core national interests. These are the interests that cannot be compromised under any circumstances. A nation must articulate these interests clearly and be willing to defend them resolutely.</p>

            <p>Statecraft is not just about managing today; it's about shaping tomorrow. A nation must have a long-term vision and a strategy to achieve it. This requires foresight, planning, and determination.</p>

            <p>In international relations, there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies. There are only permanent national interests. A nation must pursue its interests pragmatically, forming alliances and partnerships that advance these interests.</p>

            <p>Power is the ultimate currency in international relations. But power is not just about military strength. It's also about economic strength, technological prowess, cultural influence, and diplomatic reach. A smart nation leverages all forms of power to advance its interests.</p>

            <p>The world today faces complex challenges that no single nation can solve alone. Terrorism, climate change, pandemics, cyber threats - these challenges require global cooperation. But while cooperating on these issues, a nation must also protect its own interests.</p>

            <p>Information warfare has become a critical aspect of national security. Nations need to be able to control the narrative about themselves and counter false narratives. In the age of social media, perception can be as important as reality.</p>

            <p>The quality of leadership is the single most important factor in a nation's security and development. Leaders must have vision, courage, integrity, and the ability to inspire. They must be willing to make difficult decisions and stand by them.</p>

            <p>The greatest strength of a nation lies in its people. If the people are united, determined, and willing to make sacrifices for the nation, then no external threat can prevail. This is why fostering national unity, national pride, and a sense of common purpose is so important.</p>

            <p>Security and development go hand in hand. Security without development is unsustainable, and development without security is impossible. A nation must strive for both simultaneously.</p>

            <p>Finally, it's important for a nation to believe in itself. Self-belief is the foundation of national strength. A nation that doubts itself, that is unsure of its place in the world, cannot achieve greatness. But a nation that believes in its destiny, in its ability to overcome challenges and seize opportunities, can rise to the top.</p>

            <h1>On Strategic Thinking</h1>
            <h2>by Ajit Doval</h2>

            <p><em>From lectures delivered at various academic and security forums.</em></p>

            <p>Strategic thinking is not just about planning for war; it's about shaping the environment so that war becomes unnecessary. It's about creating conditions favorable to your interests without having to resort to force.</p>

            <p>There are three types of powers in the world: those that can shape events, those that can influence events, and those that are shaped by events. The goal of strategic thinking is to move from the third category to the first.</p>

            <p>Strategic culture is shaped by history, geography, values, and leadership. India's strategic culture is deeply influenced by its ancient civilization, its diverse society, its colonial experience, and its post-independence journey.</p>

            <p>A strategic mind understands the difference between what is urgent and what is important. Often, the urgent dominates our attention, but it's the important that shapes our future. A strategic thinker focuses on the important, even while dealing with the urgent.</p>

            <p>Strategic thinking requires a deep understanding of your own strengths and weaknesses, as well as those of your adversaries. It requires a clear vision of what you want to achieve and a realistic assessment of what you can achieve.</p>

            <p>The art of statecraft lies in identifying the point where your interests and capabilities meet. This is where you can act most effectively and with the greatest chance of success.</p>

            <p>A strategic thinker understands that timing is critical. There are moments when action is necessary, moments when patience is required, and moments when both action and patience are needed in different areas.</p>

            <p>In the end, strategy is about making choices. It's about deciding what to do and, equally important, what not to do. A nation that tries to do everything will end up achieving nothing.</p>

            <p>The greatest strategic asset is a united, confident, and determined nation. All the cleverness in the world cannot compensate for a lack of these fundamental qualities.</p>

            <p>The best strategy is not the most complex or the most clever. It's the one that aligns your capabilities with your interests in a way that maximizes your chances of success. Sometimes, the simplest strategy is the most effective.</p>
