            <h1>The Immortal Bard</h1>
            <h2>by Isaac Asimov</h2>
            
            <p><em>A short story by Isaac Asimov, first published in the May 1954 issue of Universe Science Fiction.</em></p>

            <p>"Oh, yes," said Dr. Phineas Welch, "I've succeeded in traveling through time."</p>

            <p>He had been speaking quite seriously, and his friend, John Henderson, stared at him, open-mouthed. "Phineas, you're joking."</p>

            <p>"No, no. Perfectly true, I assure you."</p>

            <p>"But good Lord, man. If you've really done it, why haven't you reported it to the scientific journals? This could be the great discovery of the century. Greater!"</p>

            <p>"Why bother the journals? I haven't developed the proper theory yet. Besides, the trip was a side line. I undertook it out of curiosity. I haven't even repeated it. After all, it is an uncertain business and might be dangerous."</p>

            <p>They were in Welch's small apartment on the University grounds. A brandy bottle was on the table between them. Henderson took a thoughtful gulp and said, "You traveled through time?"</p>

            <p>"I did."</p>

            <p>"Then tell me about it."</p>

            <p>Welch leaned back in his chair, his round face crinkling up as he began to talk. "Well, I spent most of last summer in England. Feeling quite lonely, quite cut off. I was working on time, as you know, and getting nowhere much."</p>

            <p>"I know."</p>

            <p>"I used to take walks in the countryside during the cool of the evening. I used to go through little villages, sometimes all but deserted; and I would wonder about the little rectories ..."</p>

            <p>"What?"</p>

            <p>"The rectories. You know, parish houses. I would wonder if people didn't still live in pre-Victorian fashion in some of these places, and I found my thoughts reaching backward. I would think: If I could only see England in past times; if I could talk to Englishmen as they were three hundred years ago, four hundred years ago. And then I would think: What's to prevent it? Why can't I slip through time?"</p>

            <p>Henderson nodded. The physicists at the University were interested in time, all right. They had been ever since the classic work of Einstein and Minkowski. Welch, however, was a chemist.</p>

            <p>Henderson said, with a touch of malice, "I thought chemists didn't think about time much. Not the way physicists or philosophers do."</p>

            <p>Welch purpled slightly. He said, "I was trained as a physical chemist. Besides, what chemist isn't a philosopher? Or, for that matter, what chemist isn't a physicist, also? Anyway, I had been working on the problem of time for some years. It's a matter of possibility-waves, you see."</p>

            <p><em>[This is an excerpt from "The Immortal Bard" by Isaac Asimov. The full story is a witty tale where Dr. Welch claims to have brought William Shakespeare to the present day and enrolled him in a college course on Shakespeare's works - which Shakespeare fails.]</em></p>

            <h1>Eulogy for Isaac Asimov</h1>
            <h2>by Arthur C. Clarke</h2>

            <p><em>Delivered in April 1992</em></p>

            <p>I find it hard to believe that Isaac has gone. We had been friends since we met at the World Science Fiction Convention in 1953. He was a good friend. He was also one of the most brilliant, most prolific, most energetic writers of all time. I once tried to count how many books he'd written. When I got to about 500 I gave up. That was several years ago.</p>

            <p>And he had created some of the greatest classics of our field. If people do a favorite science fiction short-story poll, it's odds on that "Nightfall" will come top. The "Foundation" trilogy is almost certain to top any poll of favorite science fiction novels. And if the poll is widened to include the classics of science fact, "The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science" is a certainty for the top place there.</p>

            <p>But it wasn't only the universally agreed masterpieces that contributed to Isaac Asimov's exalted position. He has, for nearly half a century, provided us with a never-ending stream of entertaining and instructive works on subjects ranging literally from A to Z. He used to boast - and since this is a memorial, we should overlook the fact - that he had written at least one book in every category of the Dewey Classification.</p>

            <p>Isaac wasn't omniscient - though he came close enough, and I'm sorry to say that one of my most vivid memories is of him correcting my spelling. But the range of his knowledge was incredible. He was the nearest approach in our profession to an 18th Century polymath.</p>

            <p>Though Isaac often referred to himself as a mere entertainer, he was much more than that, and I believe that future historians will rank him among the great educators of our time. It's impossible to measure the impact of his scientific writings upon countless teachers, upon the general public - and, most important of all, on the young people who will be the scientists of tomorrow. I like to believe - and I'm sure he would have shared my faith - that some day a Nobel Prize winner will say, "I became a scientist because of Isaac Asimov."</p>

            <p>The time will come when no one will read Asimov's fiction, because it will have been superseded by better - though perhaps itself inspired by his pioneering work. His science fact, too, will be superseded - if not quite so quickly.</p>

            <p>But I do not believe any writer will ever match his output for quantity, quality - and, above all, clarity. That amazing brain is now at rest - but it has left a permanent imprint on the history of human thought.</p>

            <p>The words of Shakespeare come to mind, because they fit Isaac so perfectly:</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 50px;">He was a man, take him for all in all,<br>I shall not look upon his like again.</p>
