        We are not unique in suffering from moral confusion — these crises are  <br>
        a familiar story — but we are unique in the tremendous acceleration  <br>
        of the rate of social change and in the tremendous risk of a catastrophic  <br>
        end to all our hopes.
        <br>~ Alan Simpson

        How concise that you can cry from awful wounds, desertion, happiness,  <br>
        memories, humiliation, disappointment, or grandeur <br>

        When Einstein died, his greatest rival Bohr found for him words of  <br>
        moving admiration. When a few years later Bohr in turn died, someone  <br>
        took a photograph of the blackboard in his study. There's a drawing on it.  <br>
        A drawing of the light-filled box' in Einstein's thought experiment.  <br>
        To the very last, the desire to challenge oneself and understand more.  <br>
        And to the very last: doubt.

        "There's a type of person that doesn't get discouraged even if they make  <br>
        the wrong move five times in a row. They stay passionate about the  <br>
        problem; they stay passionate about trying to find a solution. They  <br>
        keep on executing and moving forward"
        <br>~ Paul Graham to Michael Jordan, Bulls vs Jazz 1998 NBA Finals

        People seem not to see that their opinion of which quantum model they  <br> 
        subscribe to is also a confession of character

        It is difficult to make much of a connection between my personal history  <br>
        and my commitment to mathematics. I began with mathematics for a simple  <br>
        reason: one cannot be a philosopher without also possessing the most  <br>
        all-encompassing scientific background possible. I began my studies with  <br>
        mathematics and then moved on to physics; in the past ten years I have been  <br>
        studying biochemistry, with the aim of acquiring a fairly ample range of  <br>
        scientific knowledge. Almost all philosophers went through a version of such  <br>      
        training: Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Leibniz ... It is a tradition in the  <br>
        history of philosophy: you cannot do philosophy without having a very solid  <br>
        and varied knowledge "in the horizon of the sciences." This is the case with  <br>
        Kant, with Bergson, with Russell, etc. In reality, mathematics is the universal <br>
        language of the sciences - hence the importance of a mathematical 
        apprenticeship.

        It should be noted that there are many people in the space industry who doubt  <br>
        reusable rockets will work, in large part because of the stress the machines  <br>
        and metal go through during launch. It's not clear that the most prized  <br>
        customers will even consider the reused spacecraft for launches due  <br>
        to their inherent risks. This is a big reason that other countries and  <br>
        companies have not pursued the technology. There's a camp of space <br>
        experts who think Musk is flat-out wasting his time, and that <br>
        engineering calculations already prove the reusable rockets to be a <br>
        fool's errand.

        Only C I have ever got in my life was in thermodynamics, so of course  <br> 
        I get handed a problem on thermodynamics.

        Think for a moment about the realities of life at Cypress and then <br>
        extrapolate it to the chip industry and Silicon Valley as a whole. Our <br>
        company has 150 product designers. We have over 70 technologists. We sell <br>
        more than 1500 products. We are working right now on 50 different new <br>
        products--from high-speed computer memories to data communications chips. <br>
        With my technical training and my managerial background, it takes me 16 <br>    
        hours a day to stay on top of this organization.
