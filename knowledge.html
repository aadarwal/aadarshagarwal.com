        We are not unique in suffering from moral confusion — these crises are 
        a familiar story — but we are unique in the tremendous acceleration 
        of the rate of social change and in the tremendous risk of a catastrophic 
        end to all our hopes.

        When Einstein died, his greatest rival Bohr found for him words of 
        moving admiration. When a few years later Bohr in turn died, someone 
        took a photograph of the blackboard in his study. There's a drawing on it. 
        A drawing of the light-filled box' in Einstein's thought experiment. 
        To the very last, the desire to challenge oneself and understand more. 
        And to the very last: doubt.

        "There's a type of person that doesn't get discouraged even if they make 
        the wrong move five times in a row. They stay passionate about the 
        problem; they stay passionate about trying to find a solution. They 
        keep on executing and moving forward"

        It is difficult to make much of a connection between my personal history 
        and my commitment to mathematics. I began with mathematics for a simple 
        reason: one cannot be a philosopher without also possessing the most 
        all-encompassing scientific background possible. I began my studies with 
        mathematics and then moved on to physics; in the past ten years I have been 
        studying biochemistry, with the aim of acquiring a fairly ample range of 
        scientific knowledge. Almost all philosophers went through a version of such 
        training: Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Leibniz ... It is a tradition in the 
        history of philosophy: you cannot do philosophy without having a very solid 
        and varied knowledge "in the horizon of the sciences." This is the case with 
        Kant, with Bergson, with Russell, etc. In reality, mathematics is the 
        universal language of the sciences - hence the importance of a mathematical 
        apprenticeship.

        It should be noted that there are many people in the space industry who doubt 
        reusable rockets will work, in large part because of the stress the machines 
        and metal go through during launch. It's not clear that the most prized 
        customers will even consider the reused spacecraft for launches due 
        to their inherent risks. This is a big reason that other countries and 
        companies have not pursued the technology. There's a camp of space 
        experts who think Musk is flat-out wasting his time, and that 
        engineering calculations already prove the reusable rockets to be a 
        fool's errand.

        Only C I have ever got in my life was in thermodynamics, so of course

        Think for a moment about the realities of life at Cypress and then 
        extrapolate it to the chip industry and Silicon Valley as a whole. Our 
        company has 150 product designers. We have over 70 technologists. We sell 
        more than 1500 products. We are working right now on 50 different new 
        products--from high-speed computer memories to data communications chips. 
        With my technical training and my managerial background, it takes me 16 
        hours a day to stay on top of this organization.
