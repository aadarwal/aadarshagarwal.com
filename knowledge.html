            We are not unique in suffering from moral confusion — these crises are 
            a familiar story — but we are unique in the tremendous acceleration 
            of the rate of social change and in the tremendous risk of a catastrophic 
            end to all our hopes.

            When Einstein died, his greatest rival Bohr found for him words of 
            moving admiration. When a few years later Bohr in turn died, someone 
            took a photograph of the blackboard in his study. There's a drawing on it. 
            A drawing of the light-filled box' in Einstein's thought experiment. 
            To the very last, the desire to challenge oneself and understand more. 
            And to the very last: doubt.

            It is difficult to make much of a connection between my personal history 
            and my commitment to mathematics. I began with mathematics for a simple 
            reason: one cannot be a philosopher without also possessing the most 
            all-encompassing scientific background possible. I began my studies with 
            mathematics and then moved on to physics; in the past ten years I have been 
            studying biochemistry, with the aim of acquiring a fairly ample range of 
            scientific knowledge. Almost all philosophers went through a version of such 
            training: Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Leibniz ... It is a tradition in the 
            history of philosophy: you cannot do philosophy without having a very solid 
            and varied knowledge "in the horizon of the sciences." This is the case with 
            Kant, with Bergson, with Russell, etc. In reality, mathematics is the 
            universal language of the sciences - hence the importance of a mathematical 
            apprenticeship.

            It should be noted that there are many people in the space industry who doubt 
            reusable rockets will work, in large part because of the stress the machines 
            and metal go through during launch. It's not clear that the most prized 
            customers will even consider the reused spacecraft for launches due 
            to their inherent risks. This is a big reason that other countries and 
            companies have not pursued the technology. There's a camp of space 
            experts who think Musk is flat-out wasting his time, and that 
            engineering calculations already prove the reusable rockets to be a 
            fool's errand.

            Think for a moment about the realities of life at Cypress and then 
            extrapolate it to the chip industry and Silicon Valley as a whole. Our 
            company has 150 product designers. We have over 70 technologists. We sell 
            more than 1500 products. We are working right now on 50 different new 
            products--from high-speed computer memories to data communications chips.
