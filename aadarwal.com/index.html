            <h1>Aadarsh Agarwal</h1>
            <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Chicago studying physics and philosophy. <a href="mailto:aadarsh@uchicago.edu">aadarsh@uchicago.edu</a> / @aadarwal on <a href="https://github.com/aadarwal">github</a>, <a href="https://x.com/aadarwal">X</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aadarwal/">YT</a></p>

            <p>As someone who has studied fundamental fields, I have had a few fundamental interests develop which have made me interested in a bunch of problems for which I hope to find a plan of attack:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Compute:</strong> Integrated Photonic, Quantum, Neuromorphic, these are some of the coolest things. This is effectively the ultimate mind and matter problem, and this is the kind of stuff that needs to be focused on for a while. <a href="https://memq.tech">memQ</a> and <a href="https://highlab.uchicago.edu/">High Lab</a> are the places that I worked at and made me align interests along this path.</li>
                <li><strong>Propulsion:</strong> I think this is fundamentally going to change everything and all of human kinds lives. Please invest in this stuff. I spent my freshman summer at <a href="https://skyroot.in">Skyroot Aerospace</a> which is one of the main reasons I strongly feel there is an urgent need for this kind of work.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Contract:</strong> Philosophy in general</li>
                <li><strong>India:</strong> If there is a general way to be able to apply as much change as is needed</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A lot of this was fundamentally based on the version of the future that I think could be created, but I really do hope that it is much weirder than we can possibly imagine.</p>

            <h3>Work + Side Quests</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>memQ:</strong> A startup working on research at the intersection of quantum sensing and network technologies. I worked as part of the integrated photonics team here.</li>
                <li><strong>High Lab, Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering:</strong> The University of Chicago has <a href="https://www.chicagoquantumexchange.org">hedged bets</a> with its quantum research push. I am particularly interested in the cryptography and communication aspects of this research.</li>
                <li><strong>Skyroot Aerospace:</strong> Probably does some of the coolest research happening in India right now, and it was great to learn from some special people there.</li>
                <li><strong>e-acc.in:</strong> India needs technical inspiration - this is what I am trying to build.</li>
                <li><strong>pascal:</strong> The future of events and there is a way to naturalize LLMs into a very special focus.</li>
                <li><strong>bhabha:</strong> I am trying to use lisp to create something like flightclub.com both because I feel that there is definitely scope for interests in such data.</li>
            </ul>
